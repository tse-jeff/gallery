        <h1>NYC Bikers</h1>
        <p>As an enthusiast of biking and an advocate for more eco-friendly modes of transportation, I wanted to
          showcase bikers in NYC. Since the pandemic, there has been a major increase in bikers in NYC. This was due to
          the proximity of others on mass transportation like subways. Citi bikes became something like the 5th largest
          public transportation in America from being an alternative to mass transit. This just shows the scale at which
          biking has grown.</p>
        <p>
          For me, biking became a necessity growing up in the suburbs. I lived in Long Island and there weren’t many
          public transportation options to commute to school or other locations to hang out with friends. Even when
          there were buses, I didn’t have the money nor access to MetroCards when staying within my town. With a bike,
          it felt like I had all the freedom in the world. As long as I could continue pedaling, I could go further.
          During high school, I’ve gone more than 20 miles straight into the city from home. It was the freedom of
          traveling without the need to ask my parents for a ride that brought me excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, living in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, right across the Brooklyn Navy Yard, there aren’t any subways close
          by. Just having another mode of personal transportation not only saves time but also saves money. Two
          seventy-five to Manhattan and back can rack up a significant sum. After all of that, there’s also the aspect
          of removing cars from the roads and being a more green and sustainable city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Electric personal vehicles have also had an increase in popularity. It seems like half the bikes on the road
          are electric. Most delivery bikers have electric bikes or scooters. I recently bought into electric
          transportation by purchasing an electric skateboard. This allowed me to explore the city outside of the
          predefined subway lines much faster and less tiring than biking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biking or skating has become my main source of transportation. Besides the freedom of where I wanted to go, it
          has also become a very useful tool. In this collection of works, I wanted to show what it’s like to be a biker
          in NYC. Specifically, I wanted to capture commuters during the day and also at night. I stood mainly around
          two locations and tried to capture the diversity of the commuters and their vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the presentation, I wanted to compare every photo to at least another photo with similar traits. This
          could be the direction they were facing, background, and motion. It was exciting to put them together.
